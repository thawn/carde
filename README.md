# Automated carbide detection

Tool to detect carbides in scanning electron micrographs of steel.

During the production and heat treatment of steel, carbides with a size ranging between 10 nm up to a few Âµm precipitate in the steel matrix. While the carbides contribute to the steels yield strength, the largest carbides can be responsible for crack initiation leading to brittle fracture. Thus, a detailed quantitative description of carbides (e.g. number density, size distribution etc.) in a steel is of great interest.
On a polished sample, carbides can be observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In the present case, SEM micrographs of a reactor pressure vessel steel have been recorded, in which carbides can be recognized.

## Installation


1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thawn/carde.git
   cd carde
   ```
2. download and extract the data as described in [data/README.md](data/README.md)
3. create a virtual environment (using python 3.11 or above), and install the dependencies
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install uv
   uv pip install -e .
   ```
   in case you would like to reproduce the hyperparameter optimization or run the unit tests, install the optional `dev` dependencies
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
